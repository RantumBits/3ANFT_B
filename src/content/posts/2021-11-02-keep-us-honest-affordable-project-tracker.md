Every show we try to find an affordable project NFT project. As a part of our ongoing show we will keep track of the projects and how they fair after our recommendations. For fun, we'll also track who recommended the NFT. Note that we may own some of these projects and will always disclose that during the show, though we may buy in later it's all on the blockchain. 

The following is our public tracking spreadsheet to keep us honest.\

NOTE: There was a limit of 0.2 ETH in an effort to keep projects "affordable" originally. This limit was eliminated when George recommended a project at 0.5 ETH, and subsequently introduced attribution on this tracker. Andrew's own investment NFT investments and recommendations vary considerably from what is attributed here, though have often fallen outside of the orignal affordability qualification.
