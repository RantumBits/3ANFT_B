Every show we try to find an affordable project NFT project. As a part of our ongoing show we will keep track of the projects and how they fair after our recommendations. For fun, we'll also track who recommended the NFT. Note that we may own some of these projects and will always disclose that during the show, though we may buy in later it's all on the blockchain. 

The following is our public tracking spreadsheet to keep us honest.
